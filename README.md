# Deep_Calibration
A pytorch implemention for deep calibration of complicated derivatives pricing model such as rough Bergomi.

I implement part of my bachelor's thesis: High frequency calibration method for derivatives dynamic model: Based on deep ResNet and quasi-Newton algorithm.

Main reference paper: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3322085 and its code implemention repository: https://github.com/amuguruza/NN-StochVol-Calibrations. I give it a pytorch version. What's more, I optimize the neural network by adding residual block structure and test the KAN ("KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks").
